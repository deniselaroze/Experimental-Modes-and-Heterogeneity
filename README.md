# Experimental-Modes-and-Heterogeneity

## Contents:
1. Code - Instructions and Z-tree files for replication of experiments (both online and lab)
2. Data - CSV and raw exports for each of the four separate experiments
3. R-scripts - All R code for generation of statistics, tables and figures. Key files:
   * replication.R - main replication file
   * dist_diff.R - function (sourced in replication.R) to calculate bootstrapped estimates of differences within CATE bands
4. Screenshots - of lab and online experiments

## Replication R code:

The structure of the replication.R file is as follows:
1. Code to format and standardise the raw data extracts from each experimental mode
2. Descriptive statistics code
3. All tables within the main body of text
4. All figures within the main body of text
5. All appendix tables
